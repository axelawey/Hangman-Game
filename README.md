# Python Hangman Game

This is a basic implementation of the classic Hangman game using Python. It provides a simple yet engaging console-based experience where players try to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. The game offers immediate feedback, tracks progress, and allows customization through different difficulty levels and word categories.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to start the game:
   ```
   python Hangman Game.py
   ```
5. The game will prompt you to start guessing.
6. Once the game starts, enter your guesses one letter at a time.
7. The game will provide feedback on whether the letter is correct or not.
8. Keep guessing until you either uncover the entire word or run out of attempts.

## Features


- Real-time feedback on guessed letters.
- Clear and intuitive console interface.
- Track of remaining attempts and already guessed letters.

## Future Enhancements

This basic version of the Hangman game can be expanded and improved in several ways:

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Implement a scoring system to keep track of high scores.
- Incorporate a word dictionary for an extensive word bank.
- Include hints or clues to assist players in their guesses.
- Implement multiplayer mode for playing with friends.
